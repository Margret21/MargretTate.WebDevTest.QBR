  <h3>Do you need to register with the DCRA Corporations Division before you can get a DC business license?</h3>

<p>If your business is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, it needs to be registered and in good standing with the DCRA Corporations Division. You will need to list a DC registered agent and office when you register with the DCRA Corporations Division. We can be your registered agent for all the DC agencies.
 </p> 
<h3>How do you register your DC business with the DCRA Corporations Division?</h3>

<ul><li>Domestic DC corporations - file Articles of Incorporation with the DCRA Corporations Division. </li>
<li>Domestic DC LLCs - file the Articles of Organization with the Corporations Division.</li>
<li>Foreign Corporations and LLCs (already formed in another state) - file a Foreign Registration Statement with the DCRA Corporations Division. You will need to include Certificate of Good Standing from your home state.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The DCRA Corporations Division allows you to file online or submit a paper form.
  Do you need a DC registered agent to start your business?</h3>

<P>Yes. You need to list a registered agent on your business license application unless you are a sole proprietor and a resident of DC. This means that non-residents, corporations, partnerships, and LLCs all need to list a registered agent on the DC business license application.

We are a DC registered agent who can accept official documents for your business at our DC address. We scan and upload documents to your online account so you can see them immediately. You can list us as your registered agent for the DCRA Corporations Division and the Business License Division.</P>

<h3>What kind of DC Business License do you need?</h3>

<p>The DC business license you need really depends on your businesses activities. Retail and office type businesses usually just need a General Business License. The general business license classification is a catchall. It applies to businesses that have a tax identification number, but perform a business activity that does not require a special endorsement. </p>
  
<h3>How do you get a DC Business License?</h3>

<p>Some types of DC business licenses, including the DC General Business License, can be applied for on the DCRA Business Licensing website. 
If you need a special license endorsement, you will probably need to file the paper form. You can download the DC Basic Business License Application (BBL-EZ) on the DCRA Business License Division website (see link below). The DC business license application is in your online account when you sign up for DC registered agent service. It is prepopulated with our registered agent information!</p>
 
 <h3> What are the fees for a DC General Business License?</h3>

<p>All applicants for a DC business license have to pay an application fee, license fee, and additional fees for any endorsements. Once you add up all these fees, the DCRA tacks on a technology fee that equals 10 percent of the total. 
DC General Business License (no endorsements)
Application fee: $70
General endorsement fee: $25
License fee: $200
Technology fee: $29.50 (10 percent of sub-total)
Total fees: $324.50</p>
  
<h3>Do you need a federal tax ID number to get DC general business license?</h3>

<p>Yes. Get your tax ID number before you apply for your DC General Business License.</p>
  
<h3>Do you need to register your DC business with the Office of Tax and Revenue?</h3>

<p>Yes. You can register on the Office of Tax and Revenue online or by filing the FR-500 form. Include a copy of the tax registration with your DC business license application.</p>
  
<h3>Do you need to get a Certificate of Occupancy to get a DC business license?</h3>

<p>If you have a business premise located in DC and it doesn’t already have a certificate of occupancy, you will need to get one. If you live in DC and work from home, you will need a Home Occupation Permit. You can download the application on the DCRA website, but you have to submit it to the DCRA in person. They will take about 30 days to process the application.
You don’t have to attach the actual certificate to your BBL-EZ application. Just write the Certificate of Occupancy number and issue date on the application. </p>

<h3>What does it mean to have Clean Hands? </h3>

<p>You have to certify that you do not owe more than $100 to the DC government. This means if you have unpaid fines, parking tickets, or taxes you can’t get a DC business license.</p>

<h3>  How do you renew your DC business license?</h3>

<p>DC businesses have to renew the DC business license every two years. Your renewal fee is the same as the license fee, so if you have a general license, it will cost $200 every other year. The DCRA Business License Division will send you a renewal notice and invoice. Just follow the instructions on the DC business license renewal notice.

A lot of DC businesses can renew their licenses online now. If your renewal invoice has a six-digit PIN number, you can use that to renew your business license on the DCRA website.
